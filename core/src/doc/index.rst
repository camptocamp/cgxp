API Reference
=============

CGXP components and data utility classes extend map related functionality to
equivalent classes in Ext.  The API reference here documents the properties,
methods, and events that are extensions or modifications to the Ext parent
classes.  Documentation for each class contains links to the Ext parent class,
and for a full picture of the API, it is essential to have a copy of the
`Ext API Documentation`_ at hand.

CGXP classes are typically configured with OpenLayers or GeoExt objects.  For
detail on methods and properties provided by these objects, see the
`OpenLayers API Documentation`_ and `GeoExt API Documentation`_.
